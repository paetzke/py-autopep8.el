;; Keywords: convenience
;; Version: 2016.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides the `py-autopep8' command, which uses the external "autopep8"
;; tool to tidy up the current buffer according to Python's PEP8.

;;; Usage

;; To automatically apply when saving a python file, use the
;; following code:

;;   (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'py-autopep8-enable-on-save)

;; To customize the behaviour of "autopep8" you can set the
;; py-autopep8-options e.g.

;;   (setq py-autopep8-options '("--max-line-length=100"))

;;; Code:

(defgroup py-autopep8 nil
  "Use autopep8 to beautify a Python buffer."
  :group 'convenience)

(defcustom py-autopep8-command "autopep8"
  "The location of the autopep8 command (otherwise find in PATH)."
  :group 'py-autopep8
  :type 'string)

(defcustom py-autopep8-options nil
  "Options used for autopep8.

Note that `-' and '--exit-code' are used by default."
  :group 'py-autopep8
  :type '(repeat (string :tag "option")))
